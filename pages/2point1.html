      <h2>Key Terms</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>observation - the process of obtaining information by using the senses; the information obtained by using the senses.</li>
        <li>hypothesis - a testable idea or explanation that leads to scientific investigation.</li>
        <li>prediction - a statement made in advance that expresses the results that will be obtained from testing a hypothesis if
        the hypothesis is supported; the expected outcome if a hypothesis is accurate.</li>
        <li>variable - a factor that changes in an experiment in o   rder to test a hypothesis.</li>
        <li>experimental group - in an experiment, a group that is identical to a control group except for one factor and that is
        compared with the control group.</li>
        <li>control group - in an experiment, a group that serves as a standard of comparison with another group to which the control
        group is identical except for one factor.</li>
        <li>data - any pieces of information acquired through an observation or experiment.</li>
        <li>correlation - the linear dependence between two variables.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Reading Checks</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>What is the difference between a hypothesis and a prediction?</li>
        <p>A hypothesis is a testable idea or explanation that leads to a scientific investigation, and
          a prediction is a logical statement about what will happen if the hypothesis is correct.</p>
        <li>How did drawing a map of London help John Snow solve the cholera problem in 1854?</li>
        <p>He marked polluted water sources and the homes of whoever died from cholera. Doing this helped
        pinpoint which water pump was mainly polluted and caused many deaths, and shut it off, clearing the
        other water sources.</p>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Case Study</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Why did the students ensure that the conditions in both aquariums were identical?</li>
        <p>The students ensured the conditions were identical so there would be no mistakes in the
          process, such as the tempature in the tank being too low, killing them in the process.
        </p>
        <li>How would you change the hypothesis if mussels died in both aquariums?</li>
        <p>I would change the hypothesis saying that it was never phosphorus that killed
        them, instead changing it to issues with the water tempature. Perhaps due to warming,
        the water became too hot!</p>
      </ol>

      <h1>Review</h1>
    </header>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>Describe the steps of the experimetal method.</li>
        <p>1. Observing - Using the senses to observe something and ask questions.</p>
        <li>Name three scientific habits of mind and explain their importance.</li>
        <li>Explain why a hypothesis is not just a guess.</li>
        <li>Explain how scientists try to answer question that cannot be tested with experiments.</li>
        <li>Read the description of experiments. Describe the two essential parts of a good experiment,
        and explain their importance.</li>
